## What we are building
Lime is a social media app, which allows you to post images and text messages 
which will be visible inside a certain area. Lime was originally built in java 
 as a native android app. In Order to provide an iOS version as well the app gets
 rebuilt using Flutter. We will release the iOS Flutter version soon all basic
 features are working and the plan is to replace the native app as soon as the 
 flutter version becomes more powerful to provide an unified experience using one 
 codebase. We will also build a web-version which also uses Dart as primary 
 language.

## Getting Started

Lime is built using Dart and the amazing Flutter :heart: <br>
For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](http://flutter.io/).

I have also written an article about how Lime is built using Flutter (25.05.2017)
here: [How lime is built](https://github.com/fablue/building-a-social-network-with-flutter).
This should help you getting started into Lime development :relaxed:

We encourage you to use all best practices provided by the flutter team.
 
Looking forward to your contribution :+1:
